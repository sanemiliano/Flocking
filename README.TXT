### Instructions
The whole simulation was done in java, with the graphic libray BlueJ.
Every class except for StdDraw was done by myself, now that I've finished I see it could have saved a lot of time using some libraries for vectors and figures, but it was fun though.
You can configure several things, here are the controls:
    Press:
        '1' : switches separation rule boolean.
        '2' : switches aligment rule boolean.
        '3' : switches cohesion rule boolean.
        '4' : releases a new agent in the position (x,y) of the mouse.
        '5' : releases a new obstacle in the position (x,y) of the mouse.
        'q' : selects the separation weight variable.
        'w' ; selects the aligment weight variable.
        'e' : selects the boolean weight variable.
        'r' : selects the maxspeed variable.
        't' : decreases the selected variable.
        'y' : increases the selected variable.
